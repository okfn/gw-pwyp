        <div class="text text2">Laws such as Section 1504 of the US Dodd-Frank Act and similar legislation in the EU outlaw this kind of secrecy by requiring oil, gas and mining companies to publish the payments they make to governments. Shining a light on these massive payments will allow communities to ask questions and hold governments and companies accountable so that natural resources can benefit everybody.</div>
